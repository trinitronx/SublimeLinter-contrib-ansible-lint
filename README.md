SublimeLinter-contrib-ansible-lint
==================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mliljedahl/SublimeLinter-contrib-ansible-lint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mliljedahl/SublimeLinter-contrib-ansible-lint)

This linter plugin for [SublimeLinter][docs] provides an interface to [ansible-lint](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-lint). It will be used with files that have the “Ansible” syntax.

## Installation
SublimeLinter 4 must be installed in order to use this plugin. If SublimeLinter 4 is not installed, please follow the instructions [here][installation].

### Linter installation
Before using this plugin, you must ensure that `ansible-lint` is installed on your system. To install `ansible-lint`, do the following:

1. Install [Python](http://python.org/download/) and [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).

1. Install `ansible-lint` by typing the following in a terminal:
   ```
   [sudo] pip install ansible-lint
   ```

**Note:** This plugin requires `ansible-lint` 3.0.1 or later.

### Syntax installation
Also ensure that [Ansible](https://github.com/clifford-github/sublime-ansible) is installed in Sublime Text. To install `Ansible`, do the following:

To install via Package Control, do the following:

1. Within Sublime Text, bring up the [Command Palette][cmd] and type `install`. Among the commands you should see `Package Control: Install Package`. If that command is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it. There will be a pause of a few seconds while Package Control fetches the list of available plugins.

1. When the plugin list appears, type `ansible`. Among the entries you should see `Ansible`. If that entry is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it.

**Note:** If `Ansible` syntax is not installed this plugin will not work.

#### Syntax configuration
To be able to automatically open the `.yml` files in an Ansible project with the Ansible syntax, `ApplySyntax` needs to be configured with the settings below. If this is not done the `.yml` files will be opend with the YAML syntax and the linter plugin will not work without manually change the syntax for every file.

The settings can be found under:

```
Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> ApplySyntax -> Settings - User
```

**Note:** The configuration syntax/schema for ApplySyntax plugin has changed in versions `>= 4.0`.

For ApplySyntax versions `>= 4.0`:

```
    "syntaxes": [{
        "syntax": "Ansible/Ansible",
        "rules": [
          {"file_path": ".*/tasks/.*\\.yml$"},
          {"file_path": ".*/handler/.*\\.yml$"},
          {"file_path": ".*/(.*_)?vars/.*\\.yml$"},
          {"file_path": ".*/roles/.*\\.yml$"},
          {"file_path": ".*/.*ansible.*/.*\\.yml$"},
          {"file_path": ".*/playbooks/(.*/)?.*\\.yml$"}
        ]
      }]
```

For ApplySyntax versions `< 4.0`:

```
    "syntaxes": [{
        "name": "Ansible/Ansible",
        "rules": [
          {"file_name": ".*/tasks/.*.yml$"},
          {"file_name": ".*/handler/.*.yml$"},
          {"file_name": ".*/*_vars/.*.yml$"},
          {"file_name": ".*/roles/.*.yml$"},
          {"file_name": ".*/playbooks/.*.yml$"},
          {"file_name": ".*/.*ansible.*/.*.yml$"}
        ]
      }]
```

### Linter configuration
In order for `ansible-lint` to be executed by SublimeLinter, you must ensure that its path is available to SublimeLinter. Before going any further, please read and follow the steps in [“Finding a linter executable”](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#finding-a-linter-executable) through “Validating your PATH” in the documentation.

Once you have installed and configured `ansible-lint`, you can proceed to install the SublimeLinter-contrib-ansible-lint plugin if it is not yet installed.

### Plugin installation
Please use [Package Control][pc] to install the linter plugin. This will ensure that the plugin will be updated when new versions are available. If you want to install from source so you can modify the source code, you probably know what you are doing so we won’t cover that here.

To install via Package Control, do the following:

1. Within Sublime Text, bring up the [Command Palette][cmd] and type `install`. Among the commands you should see `Package Control: Install Package`. If that command is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it. There will be a pause of a few seconds while Package Control fetches the list of available plugins.

1. When the plugin list appears, type `ansible-lint`. Among the entries you should see `SublimeLinter-contrib-ansible-lint`. If that entry is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it.

### Recommended plugin
It is highly recommended to also install the Sublime plugin [Trailing Spaces](https://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces) by using [Package Control][pc]. And to set the `Trim On Save` option to `true`.

The settings can be found under:

```
Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings
```

```
    { "trailing_spaces_trim_on_save": true }
```

## Settings
